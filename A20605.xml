            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Nox praece≈øsit.</hi> Three kindes of nights are heere vnder≈øtood by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whereof he ioyed that they were ouerpa≈ø≈øed. The fir≈øt the night of ignorance, the ≈øecond of ≈øinne, the third of negligence. To the≈øe, in regard of our ≈øelues, and the≈øe times, I will adde a fourth, the night of errors. So that of the≈øe the two fir≈øt goe before the receiuing of the faith, namely the night of blinding igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and tyrannizing ≈øinne; the other two follow the faith receiued, namely ≈øtupifying negligence, and infecting error.</p>
               <p>Yee haue often reade, and many of you con≈øidered the ≈øtrange maner of ≈øpeech v≈øed in the holy Scriptures, in the di≈øtinction of the ≈øix dayes of the Creation. <hi>And the euening, and the morning, were the fir≈øt day:</hi> Euery day hath its night, the day goeth before, and the night followeth after, the morning maketh way for the euening. Surely nature requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the habite ≈øhould precede the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10339:9"/>Whereupon I conceiue not to what purpo≈øe <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> pu≈øled him≈øelfe, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled naturall Philo≈øophie, by ≈øhouldring in after Matter &amp; Forme, Priuation for a third principle of naturall bodies, vnle≈ø≈øe hee meant hereby, that what≈øoeuer is generated, maketh a pa≈ø≈øage from not beeing vnto bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But if ≈øo, yet this not beeing might well bee termed negation rather then priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Or rather by priuation; perhaps the Philo≈øopher would ≈øignifie vnto vs the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inclination of matter to receiue a new forme, which appetite is very improperly called priuation. Now, as for the text <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum e≈øt ve≈øpere, &amp; mane &amp;c.</hi> It is enough for vs, that it, being a phra≈øe meerely extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, importeth a my≈øtery. Too tedious ≈øhould I bee, if I ≈øhould heere propound all the diuers opinions of the holy Fathers vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tho≈øe words. But for as much as ≈øerueth my purpo≈øe, I doubt not, but that God in his intention was willing to make man wholly diurnall, and no whit participating of the night: For hee created him right and iu≈øt, and endued him with ≈øuch gifts, whereby
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10339:10"/>hee might, if hee would, haue made to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, and to all his po≈øterity, a perpetuall ≈øpirituall day, which ≈øhould neuer haue ≈øeene any night at all. But God (ina≈ømuch as hee fore≈øaw, that wretched man would within a few houres after his creation aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the light, and ca≈øt him≈øelfe headlong into darkne≈ø≈øe) mooued with compa≈ø≈øion of him, in his determination prouided a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by de≈øtinating for mans ≈øake his owne ≈øonne, the true light, and ≈øunne of righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe to bring them from darkene≈ø≈øe to light, from night to day. And therefore it ioyes my heart to thinke how God ordayned that (be≈øides other my≈øterious interpretations) euen for the ≈øhadowing out this then hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den my≈øtery, the Scripture de≈øcribing the beginning of the world ≈øhould ≈øpeake in this wi≈øe, <hi>Factum est ve≈øpere, &amp; mane,</hi> intimating fir≈øt the euening or night of mans mi≈øery, and then the morning or day of his redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion following. For as for his fir≈øt e≈øtate of integrity and light, it was ≈øo ≈øhort, that it is not to bee accounted for a day in this kinde. And ≈øo S. <hi>Paul</hi> here not varying fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> this our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10339:10"/>contemplation, reioyceth that that night is pa≈ø≈øed, and this day arriued; ≈øaying, <hi>Nox prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øsit, dies autem appropinquauit.</hi> The night is pa≈øt, the day is at hand.</p>
               <p>By the fir≈øt of the≈øe nights I meane igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or ≈ømall knowledge of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God. But heere it may bee obiected if S. <hi>Paul</hi> had written this Epi≈øtle to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted Gentiles onely, well might he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand by this night ignorance; but writing al≈øo to the Iewes then in Rome conuerted to Chri≈øtianity, it ≈øeemeth that they could not then be taken to liue in darkene≈ø≈øe, and in the night of ignorance.

                  <note place="margin">Prou. 31.14.</note> And our Sauiour Chri≈øt being in a ≈øhip did then mo≈øt liuely repre≈øent his Church,

And in this warfare I, to my great griefe, behold the ≈øhips that are vnder the ≈øame Captaine, and Commander our Sauiour Chri≈øt, to pur≈øue one another with no le≈ø≈øe, nay perhaps with more hatred, then if they were indeed the ≈øhips of the enemy. The Church of Rome, and tho≈øe that follow the conduct of it, hate to the death the Reformed Churches. And
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10339:17"/>the Reformed hate them. I would faine ≈øet you right, my Auditors, in a great, and very common mi≈øtake, if ≈øo bee that yee thinke the Reformed Religion to bee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion wholly differing from the Romane.

Hee that without the≈øe, or with a fal≈øe Compa≈ø≈øe, or Mappe, ≈øaileth out of all ≈øight of ≈øhoare, may bee ≈øaide to wander in vtter darkene≈ø≈øe, and midnight, though it be at noone-tide; And contrary wi≈øe, hee that is furni≈øhed with a true Compa≈ø≈øe, though hee ≈øaile in the deepe of Sea, and of night, yet hee enioyeth the day, and cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his pa≈ø≈øage at all occa≈øions. Now for the difference of the Reformed Shippes, and the Romane, it is not in the bottome,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10339:18"/>nor in the tackeling, but onely in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øe. The Romane ≈øhippe is a good Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell, well built, not rotten, nor fallen in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; it is well furni≈øhed with Ma≈øts, with Yards, with Cordage, with Cables, with Anchors; it hath an excellent Sea-mappe: the pa≈ø≈øengers, and common ≈øouldiers in it are all vnder the colours of one and the ≈øame Generall, our Sauiour Chri≈øt. And in the≈øe there is no difference betweene this Ship, and the reformed. But I finde one maine difference betweene them, whence al≈øo ari≈øe an innumerable other di≈øparities, and it is, that the Pilot, who ≈øits at the ≈øterne of the Romane ≈øhip, hauing throwne a≈øide the ordinary Compa≈ø≈øe, and leauing the v≈øe of the approoued Sea-mappe, hath out of his owne capricious conceit deui≈øed a new Card, and contriued a new-found Compa≈ø≈øe of his owne, who≈øe needle hath no a≈øpect toward the Pole, or touch at all of the Load-≈øtone. Suteable al≈øo hereto hath he out of his owne head framed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Cardinall windes, which ≈øerue onely for his Card. Nay (which is wor≈øe then
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10339:19"/>this) hee hath intruded into the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of gouerning the helmes of all the ≈øhippes, that roade in his company, and from euery of them hee hath taken away the v≈øe of the ordinary Compa≈ø≈øe, and beating the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, and ouer awing them by tyranny (who otherwi≈øe would doe well, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their office aright) will haue no nay, but all tho≈øe ≈øhippes mu≈øt daunce atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance after his. And ≈øo, for that hee v≈øeth no true Compa≈ø≈øe, nor Carde, hee ringleads them all to wracke, and they follow him fa≈øt enough without light through the thicke≈øt darkene≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>For the vnfolding of this Metaphore, I ≈øay in a word, that the Bi≈øhoppe of Rome at this pre≈øent, and for many ages pa≈øt, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the trauailers true Sea-card, the holy Scriptures, and the vnmooueable North-Pole, the aime at Heauen and heauenly things; and propounding to him≈øelfe one onely Port, his owne greatne≈ø≈øe, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall pompe, hath in his deui≈øed Compa≈ø≈øe quartered out his owne counterfeit windes, which mu≈øt blow for that hauen; they are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10339:19"/>dominion ouer all other Churches, ma≈øtery ouer the Keyes, infallibility of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and authoritie in things Temporall, euen ouer Princes. And as for the poore pa≈ø≈øengers, and common ≈øouldiers, who are tran≈øported, and blindly clapt vp vnder the hatches in the≈øe wandring ≈øhippes, he hath, to amu≈øe them, added in his fal≈øe Card ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ba≈øtard windes, painted out in guilded, and flouri≈øhed lines; namely, our owne, and others merits, Inuocation of Saints, religious wor≈øhip of Images, the trea≈øure of Indulgences, efficacie of Ma≈ø≈øes, and of Prie≈øtly ab≈øolutions, <hi>Agnus Dei's,</hi> hallowed Beads, holy Water. By the≈øe, and other ≈øuch windes neuer found in the ancient true Compa≈ø≈øes, and whereof the ancient Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots of the holy Church neuer heard any newes; by the≈øe bla≈øts will hee haue his followers to ≈øaile, whereby they are caried headlong into many mo≈øt important er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. The onely cau≈øe of all this mi≈øchiefe is that Archpilot. For if hee were remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or could bee per≈øwaded to leaue his owne mon≈øtrous Chimericall Compa≈ø≈øe,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10339:20"/>and to betake him≈øelfe to the v≈øuall and auncient guide, pre≈øently defacing all tho≈øe fal≈øe windes, verily the goodly fleete of the Catholique Church would ea≈øily bee ≈øet right, and holding the ≈øafe and ≈øure way (as the Reformed Companies haue done) would approach to the true hauen of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bli≈ø≈øe. True it is, that the≈øe Reformed Churches, beeing mi≈øledde by this wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring guide, did ≈øometime follow that vaine and deceitfull Compa≈ø≈øe. But at length they haue better bethought them≈øelues and ca≈øting out that ≈øtrange intruding Pilot, they haue yeelded vp their ≈øhippe to bee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by their owne true Steer≈øemen, ≈øuch as God him≈øelfe hath ordayned. And ≈øo v≈øing the infallible Card of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the true Compa≈ø≈øe quartered out into the foure auncient Cardinall windes of the foure fir≈øt generull Councels, and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with the vnder-windes of the holy Fathers, they make an happy voyage, and without wandring arriue at the appointed hauen of ≈øaluation. And this is the mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble night of manifold errours, wherein ≈øo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10339:20"/>many poore ≈øoules ≈øuffer them≈øelues to bee hoodwinked, and lulled a≈øleepe: from which yet we are re≈øcued by the Almighty hand of God. And therefore let vs yeelde him all po≈ø≈øible thankes, that <hi>This night is pa≈ø≈øed.</hi>

               <p>It is very much behoouefull to the Pope for the mainteining him≈øelfe in the forged greatne≈ø≈øe of his vniuer≈øall Vicar≈øhip of Chri≈øt, to holde the people in the deepe≈øt darkne≈ø≈øe of ignorance, and blindne≈ø≈øe, that po≈ø≈øibly may be. To this purpo≈øe one maine article, which he cau≈øeth to be taught in all
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10339:21"/>the Churches ≈øubiect to him, ≈øtands him in great ≈øtead; namely, that, for the ≈øauing of mens ≈øoules, an implicite faith ≈øufficeth: whereby a man beleeueth all to be trueth, what≈øoeuer the holy Catholique Romane Church beleeueth, and mainteineth. And by this meane the Pope layeth open a way for him≈øelfe to per≈øwade the ≈øilly people, already blinded with this credence, to beleeue, and receiue what≈øoeuer hee impo≈øeth on them for his owne aduantage, and to make them admit for an article of faith, that hee is the onely vicar of Chri≈øt: that he cannot erre <hi>in cathedra,</hi> iudging out of his chaire: that he is the Lord paramount of the whole Church: that the keyes, and trea≈øure of holy Church are in his hands onely: that he hath power to depo≈øe Kings from their Thrones, and to di≈øcharge their ≈øubiects of their oath of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie; and infinite other ≈øuch fopperies: for the maintenance whereof, many wretches ca≈øt away their ≈øoules. And by degrees it will come to that pa≈ø≈øe one day, that he will make him≈øelfe to be adored for a God vpon earth. By this engine of implicite faith, he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10339:21"/>barreth vp the way to the people, ≈øo that they cannot come to de≈øcry his inuentions, as long as they make it a ≈øcruple of con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to examine, or con≈øider what trueth may bee in ≈øuch determinations, which are made by him for his owne aduantage onely, and not for their ≈øoules health. In this meane while the poore vulgar think, that they haue as much faith, as will ≈øerue for their ≈øaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and yet in fine they will bee found to haue none at all. I beleeue that, which the Church beleeues. If I come not to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar articles, I yet beleeue nothing, but onely am in a di≈øpo≈øition to beleeue that, which the Church of Rome ≈øhall pre≈øcribe mee, whether true, or fal≈øe. Verely for any man to ≈øay, I beleeue that, which another man belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, is as much, as if he ≈øaid, I ≈øee that, which another man ≈øeeth, though my owne eyes be ≈øhut. And as no man can be ≈øaid to ≈øee, but only when the faculty of his owne ≈øight exerci≈øeth its operation vpon a particular obiect; ≈øo there is no actuall beleeuing, but when the vnder≈øtanding, and will doe actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally apprehend, and embrace the obiect of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10339:22"/>faith. There are vnder the Papacy, there are among the people many men endued by God with ≈øufficient iudgement and capacity to receiue good in≈øtruction in many my≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our faith, if they had conuenient meanes and opportunity to learne them: but by rea≈øon of this implied faith, they are not only kept from learning tho≈øe things which they ought to know, but al≈øo a great number of them, and they not of the dullards, when they vnder a confu≈øed notion apprehend ≈øuch articles, frame to them≈øelues fal≈øe, and erroneous conceipts of them. How many being enwrapped in this implicite faith, and being otherwi≈øe able di≈øtinctly to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, that there are in Chri≈øt two di≈øtinct natures, and but one onely per≈øon, and that diuine, yet thinke that Chri≈øt is man by an humane per≈øon, and ≈øo are Ne≈øtorians? How many are there, that beleeue Chri≈øt to be a meere man, and ≈øo are Arians? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beleeue that in Chri≈øt the diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane natures are confounded into one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Innumerable ≈øuch mon≈øters of all he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øies may bee found vnder this <hi>Chimaera</hi> of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10339:22"/>inuolued faith. Be≈øides this, the more to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh the≈øe mon≈øtrous errors, the Popes barre Chri≈øtian people from all means of learning the verities of the Chri≈øtian faith, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them the v≈øe of the holy Scriptures in ≈øuch language, as they may vnder≈øtand. For they are well a≈ø≈øured, that the very vulgar would, by reading the Scriptures, di≈øcouer the manifold deui≈øes, and trickes, wherwith the Popes, the Bi≈øhops, the Preachers, the Prie≈øts, and Friars delude the ≈øimple people, to draw money out of their pur≈øes, and to make them≈øelues be thought ≈øo many Gods.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10339:23"/>And that the vnion of holy Church con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteth in the vnity of faith, and in charity, whereby all Churches are combined, and embrace one the other, and not in being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any one vi≈øible head, but vnder Chri≈øt, the true, and only head of the Church. They would well know, that the Ma≈ø≈øe hath no other v≈øe, nor bringeth any other ≈øpirituall benefite, then to con≈øecrate the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Communion, and that only, when there are ≈øome, more, or le≈ø≈øe to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that the pronouncing of ≈øome part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, and whi≈øpering the re≈øt, ≈øo that the people heares it not, is but a mockery. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe that tho≈øe mimicall ge≈øtures with the hands, leggs, and eyes ≈øerue for nothing, but to ≈øet the people on gazing in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They would learne, that in the bread of the Euchari≈øt there is the true body of Chri≈øt Sacramentally, and after a wonderful maner, which to vs is inexplicable; but not in fle≈øh and bones, with eyes, hands, and feet.

They would vnder≈øtand, that Purgatory, being not once named, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the Scriptures, is an inuention of the Prie≈øts, and Friars, to make men call for Ma≈ø≈øes, and to draw on paiments, and obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the re≈øcuing of ≈øoules out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory. Which deuice ray≈øeth an income, whereby ≈øuch a ≈øwarme of idle≈øbies (not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnprofitable to the Church, but al≈øo ≈øcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous) are maintained, liuing in iollity, and wallowing in all vncleanne≈ø≈øe. The≈øe, and many other like trueths would the people de≈øcrie, if they might read the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor would they ≈øuffer them≈øelues to be any longer deceiued, and fuddled vp in that darke cloud, and night of infolded faith. Much the ea≈øier al≈øo would they vnder≈øtand the≈øe things, if together with the Scriptures, diuers godly, and holy Bookes might bee ≈øuffered to come to their view, which di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the impo≈øtures of the Papacie, and ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10339:24"/>lay down the true way to ≈øaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>; yet the≈øe Bookes are mo≈øt fal≈øly by the Pope, for his owne behoofe, declared to be hereticall, and prohibited, as pe≈øtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t in that kind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euer ≈øhewing particularly wherin the≈øe pretended here≈øies con≈øi≈øt: Which are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding taught by the holy Fathers of the Church.

And, as for ≈øo many ≈øoules running this way headlong into hell, that troubleth him not, may he the while hold vp his wordly pomp. And ≈øo much of the fir≈øt generall error.</p>
               <p>Another generall error, wherewith the captiuated Churches in Italy, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther el≈øewhere are ≈øeduced, is the per≈øwading of the ≈øimple people, that they obtaine infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible remi≈ø≈øion of all their ≈øinnes committed after bapti≈øme, by vertue of certaine exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ≈øen≈øible, and materiall actions, which are called Sacraments, and Sacramentals. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the common people being by nature prone, and ha≈øty to ≈øuper≈øtition, and more willing, and ready to vndergoe externall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie performances, then inward duties diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10339:24"/>and di≈øta≈øtful to fle≈øh and blood, put too much confidence in the≈øe outward ≈øuper≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, being in the meane time de≈øtitute of the true inward effect of de≈øired remi≈ø≈øion of their ≈øinnes, and ≈øo the blinde being led by the blinde, both fall into the pit.</p>
               <p>The true Sacraments in≈øtituted by our Sauiour for remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øinnes, are holy Bapti≈øme, and the ≈øacred Communion. And the only true and reall remedy, whereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of ≈øinnes, done after Bapti≈øme, is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, is Repentance, which con≈øi≈øteth in true ≈øorrowing for ≈øinne, together with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolution to leaue ≈øinne by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of Gods grace. But ≈øee how extrauagant the Papall doctrine is in this point: Namely, that it is nece≈ø≈øary to confe≈ø≈øe to a Prie≈øt all and euery of our ≈øinnes, one by one, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the circum≈øtances of them; and that thereupon pre≈øently comes ab≈øolution, which <hi>ex opere operato</hi> by vertue of the deed done, that is, infalliblie, by a Sacramentall operation, relea≈øeth the ≈øinne <hi>quantum ad cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam,</hi> as much as concernes the guiltine≈ø≈øe of it: and as for an after-reckoning <hi>quantum ad
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10339:25"/>poenam,</hi> concerning the puni≈øhment, that is remitted by ≈øatisfaction enioined, or by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences. This ≈øo mighty efficacy they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to Prie≈øtly ab≈øolution, by vertue whereof they will that a ≈øinner pre≈øently becommeth <hi>ex attrito contritus,</hi> that is to ≈øay, though he doe not truly and ≈øoundly repent him of his ≈øinnes, but conceiue a certaine ≈øleight and light ≈øorrow, out of feare onely of Gods puni≈øhments, and not out of hatred of ≈øinne, yet vpon the act of ab≈øolution, hee enioyeth the benefit of remi≈ø≈øion, as fully, as if he had true and entire repentance, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with hatred of ≈øinne. In this maner they breed vp a ≈øinner, and make him in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to cleaue fa≈øt to his ≈øinnes, while≈øt he flattereth him≈øelfe, that Confe≈ø≈øion tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his attrition into contrition. And thus poore ≈øoules, being beguiled with this blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and benighting Doctrine, tru≈øt ≈øo farre vpon this their externall Confe≈ø≈øion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Ab≈øolution, that they neglect inward repentance, and ≈øo ≈øticke fa≈øt in their ≈øinnes, thinking that they haue done their part, when they haue gone ouer the beadroule of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10339:25"/>their ≈øinnes, and ≈øo receiued Ab≈øolution. But tho≈øe good ≈øoules, that put not this ≈øuper≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fidence in any ≈øuch power of Ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution (which in trueth cannot deriue from the Go≈øpel any Sacramentall operation) and certainely per≈øwade them≈øelues, that they haue no other meanes of remedy, then true hearty repentante, they relie vpon that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and make reque≈øt to God for it by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and feruent prayers, v≈øing al≈øo other helpes, whereto the Scriptures direct vs, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtings, giuing of almes, and other workes of charitie: Not that the≈øe doe ≈øatisfie for the puni≈øhment, as the Romani≈øts vainly teach, (For God, when hee pardoneth the ≈øinne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth al≈øo the puni≈øhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, as is mo≈øt cleare in Scripture) but, becau≈øe the≈øe are fruits of inward Repentance, and parts of outward; and ≈øo make way for remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øinnes. But the Romi≈øh prepo≈øterous cour≈øe (mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and mi≈ø-doing in the darke night of this error) worketh cleane contrary, and ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the cart before the hor≈øe, fir≈øt granting remi≈ø≈øion, and afterward impo≈øing workes of repentance, which indeede ≈øhould goe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10339:26"/>before repentance, and much more before remi≈ø≈øion. And by this reckoning the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ≈øoules, when they thinke them≈øelues mo≈øt free, then remaine mo≈øt bound, and vnpardoned before the throne of God. This deui≈øe therfore of Sacramentall Confe≈ø≈øion, and Sacramentall Ab≈øolution, as they terme it, as it is pernicious, ≈øo it hath the brand of nouelty, being fir≈øt impo≈øed by Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the third: After the entrance whereof, the forme of true repentance is very hardly to bee found in the Churches ≈øubiect to the Papacy. O how much better were it for a ≈øinner not to goe to Confe≈ø≈øion, but onely when he findeth him≈øelfe in his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience rightly di≈øpo≈øed, &amp; to be in the ≈øtate of true repentance? For the often frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Confe≈ø≈øion, as it is v≈øed, and receiuing of Ab≈øolution, ≈øuch as it is, makes a ≈øinfull wretch feede him≈øelfe with ≈øhadowes, and ≈øeeme to him≈øelfe to giue his con≈øcience ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ≈øatisfaction. Whereupon he, not ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mi≈øerable e≈øtate, wherin he remains, neuer thinketh ≈øeriou≈øly of true repentance. Whereas, if hee had not that vaine imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10339:26"/>which ≈øerueth him but to cloake his ≈øinnes, he would finde him≈øelfe to bee yet in the e≈øtate of ≈øinne, and would earne≈øtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke him≈øelfe of the true remedy, namely inward ≈øincere repentance, which, without any other confe≈ø≈øion, or ab≈øolution, cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth our ≈øinnes, as fully appeareth out of the holy Scriptures, and Fathers. It is therefore an errour very grieuous, and hurtful to the ≈øoule, to beleeue that the≈øe externall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances conferre remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øinnes, and that they are nece≈ø≈øary therunto. What ≈øhall we ≈øay of ≈øo many other meere externall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, whereto the people is mo≈øt ≈øuper≈øtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly inclined, as holy water, beades, cro≈ø≈øes, con≈øecrated Images, Papall and Epi≈øcopall benedictions, Stations, Pardons, the new found hoode of the Carmelites, called the <hi>Habitell,</hi> the whipcoards of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> the girdles of the Cordeliers, the vi≈øiting of ≈øuch a Church in ≈øuch dayes, or of the≈øe and the≈øe altars, and reliques, nay the very hearing of Ma≈ø≈øes, and anealing him, that lies a dying?

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10339:27"/>≈øurfet of an imaginary, and fal≈øe deuotion. Wherupon men thinke not of purging their con≈øciences, of con≈øummating their faith, of inflaming their charity towards God, and toward their neighbor; they bu≈øie not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues about repenting of their ≈øinnes, and performing tho≈øe internall actions, wherein the e≈ø≈øentiall part of our reconciliation with God, and eternall ≈øaluation doth con≈øi≈øt. And when a man hath once in a day ≈øigned him≈øelfe with the ≈øigne of the Cro≈ø≈øe, and ≈øayd ouer his <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> (which he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtands neuer a whit) together with his <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> and hath heard Ma≈ø≈øe, why then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øooth he is a Saint, and hath learned enough in religion: and ≈øo fa≈øtning vpon the≈øe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, he ≈øets vp his re≈øt on them for his ≈øalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And, if at any time they can en≈ønare an vngrounded Prote≈øtant, and winne him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to their partie, they thinke him very well furni≈øhed, if he can beleeue in the Pope, and will heare Ma≈ø≈øe; vpon this pre≈øently, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more adoe, they declare him to bea mo≈øt perfect Catholique. Let them not heere tell me, that the inwards of the ≈øoule are ≈øtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <p>I pa≈ø≈øe now to the third generall error, and it is this: That the thunderbolt of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication darted out by the Pope is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10339:28"/>euermore very terrible, and that it ≈øtrikes deepe, wounding the ≈øoule, and tumbling it downe-right into hell, if the Popes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands be not obeyed. True it is, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bi≈øhop within his owne Bi≈øhopricke (no le≈ø≈øe then the Pope within the Bi≈øhopricke of Rome) hath power to excommunicate grieuous, and ≈øcandalous offenders, either debarring them of Eccle≈øia≈øticall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with other Chri≈øtian people, vntill they amend; or, if the ca≈øe bee de≈øperate, ca≈øting them out of the Church, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them off from the body of Chri≈øt, as dead and rotten members. But when≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ≈øuch Excommunications are ≈øent out without iu≈øt, yea and mo≈øt weighty cau≈øe, they more hurt him that thundereth them out, then them, again≈øt whom they are bent. It mu≈øt needes therefore be a great folly, to ≈øtand in feare of the Popes Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication when≈øoeuer hee threatens in this ≈øort, Either beleeue what≈øoeuer I ≈øay, or I will excommunicate you: Either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to be ≈øupreme Lord of all the world both in ≈øpirituall, and temporall matters,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10339:29"/>or you ≈øhall be excommunicated: Either acknowledge, and wor≈øhip mee for a god vpon earth, or you ≈øhall bee held for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate. To bring his owne ends to pa≈ø≈øe, he worketh in this ≈øort: hee compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth men both to beleeue, and al≈øo to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme what≈øoeuer he plea≈øe: hee forelayeth meanes to keepe ≈øimple ouerfearefull men in awe, ≈øo that they ≈øhall not dare to ≈øtand out in their owne defence again≈øt his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie. By the≈øe vaine terrors he taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the v≈øe of many excellent bookes, therefore prohibited, becau≈øe they lay open his collu≈øions. Neuerthele≈ø≈øe this rule is certaine, and infallible, who≈øouer, walking vprightly in the ≈øight of God, with ≈øinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heart, and hone≈øt intention, readeth bookes, not out of carnall curio≈øity, but out of de≈øire to learne, and to di≈øcerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene truth and fal≈øehood, and to the end that hee may not alwaies remaine blind, let him not feare a whit, nor make any account of ≈øuch Excommunication, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ≈øeparate any man from God, vnle≈ø≈øe hee hath in his owne heart fir≈øt ≈øeparated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe

                  <hi>Put on the whole armour of God, that yee may bee able to ≈øtand again≈øt the wiles of the diuell. For we wre≈øtle not again≈øt fle≈øh and blood, but again≈øt principalities, again≈øt powers, again≈øt the rulers of the darkene≈øse of this world, again≈øt ≈øpirituall wickedne≈ø≈øes in high places. Put on the bre≈øtplate of righteou≈øene≈ø≈øe, ‚Äî take the ≈øhield of faith, ‚Äî the helmet of ≈øaluation, the ≈øword of the ≈øpirit which is the word of God.</hi> I hope in God, by the helpe al≈øo of your godly prayers, deare brethren, that his heauenly Maie≈øty will reach foorth to mee, and direct in my hand this ≈øword of his word, wherewith, as I haue begun, ≈øo I may bee enabled to hold
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:10339:38"/>on the combat again≈øt the Rulers of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, for the ≈øetting free ≈øo many poore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ≈øoules from a many of errours, and that I may al≈øo put this ≈øword into their owne hands, with which they of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues may worke their owne freedome from that yoake of Tyranny, which lieth ≈øo heauy vpon them.</p>
               <p>Let vs all put on the armour of light, and in ≈øpeciall, you my brethren of Italy. For if we would all with ioynt endeuour furni≈øh our ≈øelues with this armour, wee might the better hope for a glorious victory. We ≈øhall indeed put on the armour of light, if, vpon the reforming of Religion, and dete≈øtation of errors in doctrine, we ≈øhall lead an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary life, full of good edification, keeping our ≈øelues a farre off from ≈øin, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout in prayers, frequent in hearing, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the word of God, and in performance of other ≈øpirituall exerci≈øes, e≈øpecially in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the holy Communion, and al≈øo ≈øhall ≈øhew our ≈øelues fruitfull in good workes. <hi>So let your light ≈øhine before men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>that they may

To beleeue aright, and to doe that which is wrong will ≈øtand vs in little ≈øteed, nay it will ≈øinke vs the deeper, into Hell.

                  <hi>Lucerna cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris e≈øtoculus. The eye is the light of the body.</hi> And (as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> a mo≈øt worthy Bi≈øhop hereupon inferreth,)
